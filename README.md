# Joke Bot

This repository contains a conversational joke bot created using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and Gradio, a Python library for quickly creating shareable, collaborative, and cloud-ready interfaces.

## Project Overview

The Joke Bot is designed to create a joke based on a user-specified subject matter. The user enters the subjects into the input box, and the bot responds with a joke that includes those subjects. The jokes are generated by the GPT-3.5 model, using the OpenAI API.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gambiTarun/Joke-Bot.git
```

2. Move into the cloned repository.

```bash
cd Joke-Bot
```

3. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This code uses the `openai` and `gradio` Python libraries. Make sure to install these libraries before running the code.

4. Add your OpenAI API key to a file named `key.txt` in the project directory.

## Usage

You can start the joke bot by running the `joke-bot.py` script.

```bash
python joke-bot.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface in your web browser. Enter the subject of your joke into the text box and press Enter to get a joke.

## Code Explanation

This script uses the Gradio library to create an interactive interface for the joke bot. It creates a `Textbox` for user input and a `Chatbot` to display the conversation history.

When a user submits text, it calls the `predict` function with the input text. This function appends the input to the message history and then calls the OpenAI API to generate a joke based on the message history. It then adds the generated joke to the message history and returns the new message history to update the chatbot.
